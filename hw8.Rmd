1.	Fit a GEE model with size of the tree as outcome and time, environment, and their interaction as covariates. Write down the mean response of the GEE model.
```{r}
# fit the model with CS correlation matrix
library(gee)

fit_1 = 
  gee(size ~ time * treat, 
      data = hwdata4, 
      id = tree, 
      family = gaussian, 
      corstr = "exchangeable")

summary(fit_1)
